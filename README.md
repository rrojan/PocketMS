# PocketMS - Instant PocketBase CMS 

Instantly create user-facing permissioned CMS from PocketBase! ðŸš€

Just:
1. Create a `permissions: string` column in your PocketBase `users` collection
2. Generate a typescript schema from your PocketBase DB
3. Import the generated type file through the setup UI
4. You now have a fully functioning CMS

## Goals
- [ ] **Autogenerate an entire CMS**: Create a CMS from your PocketBase schema based on [Pocketbase Typegen](https://github.com/patmood/pocketbase-typegen)
- [ ] **Authentication**: Login for users and users management for admin
- [ ] **User Permissions** - display/hide links and allow/block access to page based on permissions
- [ ] **Allow configuration** (show/hide fields, order of inputs) of pages based on `pocketms.config.ts`

## Additional Goals
- [ ] Allow **SEO** / metadata management directly from CMS
- [ ] Analytics
- [ ] Localization
